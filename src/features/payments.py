"""Repayment behavior at Home Credit: installment payments and credit card months.

installments_payments has one row per payment made (or due) on an earlier loan: when it was
due (DAYS_INSTALMENT), when it was paid (DAYS_ENTRY_PAYMENT), what was due (AMT_INSTALMENT),
and what was paid (AMT_PAYMENT). credit_card_balance has one row per card per month. Both
carry SK_ID_CURR, so each groups by applicant directly.

These tables answer the lender's favorite question: does this person pay on time? Follow the
pattern of ``aggregate_bureau`` in src/features/bureau.py.

        - INST_PAYMENT_DIFF_MEAN: average of AMT_PAYMENT - AMT_INSTALMENT (negative means the

        Rows with no payment recorded (DAYS_ENTRY_PAYMENT or AMT_PAYMENT missing) are left out
        of the two shares, the late maximum, and the average, but still count in INST_COUNT.

    Hints:
        - Both DAYS_* columns count days before this application (negative), so "later" means
          a larger number.
        - A comparison with NaN gives False, which would quietly count a missing payment as
          "on time". Make the missing rows NaN before taking a share, so they drop out.
        - ``share_where`` uses every row as the denominator. Here you need a different one.
